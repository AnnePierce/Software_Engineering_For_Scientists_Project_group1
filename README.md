Software to analyze fiber photometry and behavior data from Anne Pierce's thesis project in Donaldson Lab

# Caroline's contributions 
## Caroline_Parsing_Progress
Created initial parsing.py file
Anne updated final working version

# Vibin's contributions 
## Vibin_Plotting_Progress
Creating Plotting.py file. THis file creates plots of the fluorescence signal from fiber photometry.

# Anne's contributions 
## Anne_allfunctions.py_Progress
Created all_functions.py file. Includes all functions needed to analyze fiber photometry data with behavioral data.
Created integration file to run parsing and functions file on all behaviors.
Created config.ini file
Edited the final working version of the parsing.py file. This file does the intial parsing of data to deinterleave the different fluroescence channels (i.e the 470 green, the 415 "isosbestic", and the 560 red channels). This file also creates the corresponsing time stamps for each of those channels.
